Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [T3] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks.

transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [55] B]B). Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent Lmguage models and encoderdecoder
architectures (35) 24)[5}.
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the pasitons to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden.

sequential nature prectudes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ZZ] and conditional
computation (82), while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc~
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to theie distance in
the input o outpot sequences (2[09). In all but a few cases (27), however, such attention mechanisms
are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.
In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
