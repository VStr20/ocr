# OCR

## Overview
**OCR** (Optical Character Recognition) is a Python-based project designed to detect and extract text from images. This repository contains scripts, datasets, pre-trained models, and example outputs to help users perform OCR tasks effectively.

---

## Features
- Text detection and recognition from images.
- Pre-trained model for English text (`eng.traineddata`).
- Scripts for testing, evaluation, and visualization.
- Sample datasets and images for quick testing.
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and model testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Install the required dependencies using the `requirement.txt` file:
  ```
  pip install -r requirement.txt
  ```

### Usage

1. **Run the Sample Script**  
   Perform OCR on a sample image (`sample_page.jpg`) using the `sample.py` script:
   ```
   python sample.py
   ```

2. **Test the Model**  
   Open the `test_model.ipynb` notebook to test the OCR model on custom inputs.

3. **Image Preprocessing**  
   Use the `image.py` script to preprocess images before performing OCR.

4. **Evaluate Performance**  
   Compare the observed output (`observed_output.txt`) with the ground truth (`ground_truth.txt`) to evaluate accuracy.
